# mini_python_projects--1
Well i wanna share my pyhton journey hereso lets begin
Hi so learning is easy but to be consistent with it takes real effort 
In the world of programming one needs to constantly practice and code as its not a type of language you would remember in 10 years so yes
i started my coding journey long ago but i was not consistent and now i am coding mainly because it exites me and makes me feel talented too
so my point is just go for it and maintain it you will reach a place you never thought of 

(PS: I  still dream to work in IBM or Microsoft shh heheh are you with me to explore the world of codes?)
